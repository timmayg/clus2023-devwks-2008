# Harden IOS XE Services

Now it's time to run some Ansible Playbooks and Reduce the Attack Surface of the IOS XE box! <br>



<ol>

<li>Enable Only Secure Cryptographic Primers on the IOS XE SSH Service</li>
The SSH server on IOS XE supports several cryptographic primers that are enabled for compatibility reasons. Some of these are less secure than others. In this task we will run a playbook that will modify the SSH server to only use highly secure cryptographic primers. Modern versions of the popular SSH clients (eg. OpenSSH, putty, SecureCRT) supported these primers.

<li>View the Cat9K SSH Status. </li>
Observe the large number of primers that are options for each algorithm.

<code>show ip ssh status</code>

<li> View the SSH Hardening Playbook using cat. </li>
Note the following things in the Playbook
<ul>
<li>Call to the encrypted vault for authentication credentials</li>
<li>Usage of cisco.ios.ios_config: and lines:</li>
<li>IOS XE commands to force SSH to use strong primers</li> 
</ul>

<br>
<code>cat playbooks/ssh-harden-plays-cli.yaml</code>
<br><br>

<br><br><br>


<li>Now run the playbook.</li>
This playbook will assure that each of the algorithms are using highly secure primers.
You will be prompted for the vault password, recall we set that before, the password is <b>abcd9876</b>.

Observe the XML config that was generated by YANG Suite. Notice how some of the commands that are not supported in the YANG model need to be manually entered.
