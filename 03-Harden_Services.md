# Harden IOS XE Services

Now it's time to run some Ansible Playbooks and Reduce the Attack Surface of the IOS XE box! <br>



<ol>

<li>Enable Only Secure Cryptographic Primers on the IOS XE SSH Service</li>
Like most secure server services, the SSH Server on IOS XE supports several cipher suites that are there more for compatibility reasons than high security. In this task we will run a playbook that will modify the SSH server to only use highly secure SSH cipher suites. These strong cryptographic primers are supported in current versions of tools like OpenSSH, putty and SecureCRT. 
<br>
View the playbook using cat. Observe the XML config that was generated by YANG Suite. Notice how some of the commands that are not supported in the YANG model need to be manually entered. 
<br>
<code>cat playbooks/ssh-harden-plays-cli.yaml</code>
<br>
Now run the playbook. 
<br>
<code>ansibile-playbook -i inventories/devnet-switches.yaml playbooks/ssh-harden-plays-cli.yaml </code>
