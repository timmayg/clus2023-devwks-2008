# Harden IOS XE Services

Now it's time to run some Ansible Playbooks and Reduce the Attack Surface of the IOS XE box! <br>



<ol>

<li>Enable Only Secure Cryptographic Primers on the IOS XE SSH Service</li>
The SSH server on IOS XE supports several cryptographic primers that are enabled for compatibility reasons. Some of these are less secure than others. In this task we will run a playbook that will modify the SSH server to only use highly secure cryptographic primers. Modern versions of the popular SSH clients (eg. OpenSSH, putty, SecureCRT) supported these primers.
