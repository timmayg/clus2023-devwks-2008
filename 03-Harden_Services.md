# Harden IOS XE Services

Now it's time to run some Ansible Playbooks and Reduce the Attack Surface of the IOS XE box! <br>



<ol>

<li>Enable Only Secure Cryptographic Primers on the IOS XE SSH Service</li>
The SSH server on IOS XE supports several cryptographic primers that are enabled for compatibility reasons. Some of these are less secure than others. In this task we will run a playbook that will modify the SSH server to only use highly secure cryptographic primers. Modern versions of the popular SSH clients (eg. OpenSSH, putty, SecureCRT) supported these primers.

View the Cat9K SSH Status. 
<br>
<code>show ip ssh status</code>
<br><br>
View the playbook using cat. 
<br>
<code>cat playbooks/ssh-harden-plays-cli.yaml</code>
<br><br>
Now run the playbook. 
<br>
<code>ansibile-playbook -i inventories/devnet-switches.yaml playbooks/ssh-harden-plays-cli.yaml </code>
