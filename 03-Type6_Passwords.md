# Configure IOS XE to use Type 6 Password Encryption where Applicable

In 2023, Type 0 (cleartext) Type 5 (Md5 Hashed) and Type 7 (obfuscated) 
passwords should never be used. Type 6 passwords are stored after being 
encrypted with AES-128. 

Type 6 passwords are typically used for RADIUS & TACACS shared secrets, & IPSec 
and MACsec pre-shared-keys. Type 6 is encryption, not hashing like Type 8 & 9. 
Type 6 uses encryption because the passwords need to be decrypted so that IOS
processes can use them, eg, using an IPSec PSK to encrypt data before sending it
over the wire.

<li>View the Playbook that will enable Type 6 password storage </li>
This playbook contains two commands.  These two commands will configure a master key which will then be used to encrypt any passwords which will use Type 6 encryption. 
<br>
<code>cat playbooks/03-config-type6.yaml</code>
<br><br>

<li>Run the Playbook </li>
<br>
<code>ansible-playbook -i inventories/devnet-switches.yaml playbooks/03-config-type6.yaml --ask-vault-pass</code>

Excellent!   
Type 6 passwords have been enabled. At this time no Type 6 password 
exist on our IOS XE boxes but in the next task we will create some key chains that
will contain pre-shared-keys and they will be stored in Type 6 format! Let's go!!!
