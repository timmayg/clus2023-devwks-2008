Please use this table to determine what Pod you have been assigned. 

<li> Find your Workstation and then find your Pod FQDN in the table below. </li>

Things will break, lab will fail!  
You've been warned!

## 02. Please open 3 SSH Windows to your Pod. 

<img src="/images/10-01-lab-workstation-web.png" alt="Fresh Lab Workstation" width=600>

Run this 3 times, ADJUST for your Pod ## !

<code> ssh -p 3389 -l ciscolive podXX-xelab.cisco.com </code>

SSH Username & Password for the Ubuntu & the Cat9300 switches are all the same.
### User: ciscolive
### Password: ciscolive123

The first SSH session will be used for managing Ansible and the files. 

The second SSH session will be a jump box for you to get to the first Cat9300 switch. 

<code> ssh 10.1.1.5 </code>

The third SSH session will be a jump box for you to get to the second Cat9300 switch.

<code> ssh 10.1.1.55 </code>



I arrange my SSH sessions like this for best viewing.   Adjust them for your own preferences.
