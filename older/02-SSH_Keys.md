# Working with SSH Keys

When connecting to an SSH Server the first time the client typically doesnt have the servers public key. In Ansible this results in an error, but one that we can easily and securely solve. Let's dig in.  This client needs to have a stored copy of the servers key in order to authenticate the server and prevent a meddler-in-the-middle attack.

<br>
<li>Let's take a look at the error that Ansible throws when the key isn't stored.</li>
The error Ansible throws at us is very clear in the issue, "The authenticity of the host cannot be established due to the host being unknown."

<li>Each time you connecto to a new SSH server the servers public key is stored in the known_hosts file. Use the cat command to view the keys that are in the known_hosts file.</li>
<br>
<code>cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>
<br><br>

<li>Add tcp/22 SSH Public Key to the Known Hosts File for Cat9300-1</li>
THe output of this command shows us that we are using SSH version 2 and that the 'server' is running Cisco software. 
<br>
<code>ssh-keyscan -p 22 10.1.1.5 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts </code>

<li>Add tcp/830 NETCONF Port SSH Public key to the Known Hosts File for Cat9300-1</li>
The banner for tcp/830 will be different than the banner was for tcp/22. Do not be alarmed, this is due to the the NETCONF SSH server using different server software. 
<br>
<code>ssh-keyscan -p 830 10.1.1.5 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>
<br><br><br>

<li>Add tcp/22 NETCONF Port SSH Public key to the Known Hosts File for Cat9300-2</li>
<br>
<code>ssh-keyscan -p 22 10.1.1.55 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>
<br><br><br>

<li>Add tcp/830 NETCONF Port SSH Public key to the Known Hosts File for Cat9300-2</li>
<br>
<code>ssh-keyscan -p 830 10.1.1.55 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>
<br><br><br>

<li>Now that we've added several new keys to the known_hosts file, let's view it again.  </li>
This file may look very jumbled, that's ok.  The keys only take up one line each but they are very long so word wrap makes it look a little messy. Each key (line) starts with the hash or the IP address, take a look!
<br>
<code>cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>
